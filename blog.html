			<h1>This is my blog</h1>
			<p> Blog Entry #1 </p>  Just wanted to write down some thoughts on the first week of classes, I am a transfer student to MSU and this happens to be my first semester of classes. I feel comftorable with all my classes but there is a new atmosphere and structure here at MSU, at my previous institution, Albion College, the classes where much smaller. This is because Albion was tiny compared to MSU. I am used to more communication during and after class. Here it seems as if there is no communication during class and once class is over people put on there headphones and walk out. I hope that in the weeks to come I can meet more people and go to study sessions. Overall i'm very happy with MSU and am excited for the years to come. </p>
			Blog Entry #2 </p> Today we watched an interesting video, it protrayed a personal story aout a man who was gay. He grew up under tradgic circumstances, at a young age his uncle who was also gay resorted to suicide to escape. He described his disgust with his uncles decision to end his life and explained that now his only example is his Uncle's suicide. The video was very emotional and told the entire story from beginning to end. Though informal it did a great job protraying the emotion and story in ways that I believe a formal story could not.			</p>
			Blog Entry #3 </P> Today I had a struggle with technology, it was HORRIFIC! I like to assume that I am very talented when it comes to things like computers, smart phones, email, and financial transactions which are heavily web based. Well this is a rant if you haven't already figured out. To start the list my computer at school is freezing up and very slow. I know I can not controll it but it still is very frustrating. Another thing I can not control is the internet going out. Which it did periodically during my class today. I hope this is not a school wide issue as I have my CSE class in a couple of hours and am already holding anger in. On to the next item on the list smart phones, my smart phone seems to be malfunctioning due to age and setting alarms on its own, great for a day full of class I love being stared at by 100's of my peers in a 650 person economy class at 10 in the morning when I am wide awake and ready to fix the problem, NOT. My email and paypal are one problem as well paypal says I do not have an email linked with the account when in fact I do I acutally have two of my emails linked with paypal. Technology is really giving it to me right now. </p>
			Blog Entry #4 </p> Watching the social network in class was fun the movie was very informative and taught me a lot about facebook from a buisness perspective. The effect of facebook on communication was drastic, communicating became much easier after the invention of facebook. Facebook was made based on technology and html code this technology gave birth to facebook which in turn gave birth to a new way of communication, linking all three together. Technology introduced a new way of writing, called html and coding, which introduced a new way of communicating through facebook.</p>
			Blog Entry #5 </p>	The advertisement incorperated Eminems Lose Yourself as an instrumental. The instrumental creeped into the advertisement at the halfway mark. with the only vocals coming from a choir near the end. Detroits imagry was protrayed as a hard working factory oriented city. Where the people are tough and hard minded individuals. Eminem only had one line in the entire advertisement with a great deal of visuals of him driving the car. Overall I think the advertisement was ground breaking for a car advertisement. </p>
			Blog Entry #6 </p> <p> Getting ready to work on the remix video, my group hasnt responded to me yet, but we have a meeting scheduled for Saturday, today is Thursday. I hope everyone shows up, I feel like these type of projects usually fall on my shoulders and I really dont have the time to pull one off right now, I’ve got a loaded schedule and a few tests coming up I hope my group is ready to do their share! </p>
			Blog Entry #7 </p> <p> My dog died today, not a good day.
			Blog Entry #8 </p> <p> Update on my remix group, it is TERRIBLE, Wang is the only person who showed up to the meeting and we had to try and get the memo assignment done by ourselves, it was really tough because we were making decisions for the entire group with half the group, hopefully the rest of the team shows up for the video, this is shaping up to be a disaster at the wrong time for me, I’m off to study for my exam, really didn’t need this extra stress. </p>
			Blog Entry #9 </p> <p>Really had a rough day today, the cold weather is not fun when you are a commuter student! I waited a really long time at a bus stop I could have sworn it was over 15 minutes; these busses have really slowed down since the beginning of the year. Nothing I can do about it though, so I’m ready to get to class and do some work!</p>
			Blog Entry #10 </p> <p>Almost done with my Memo for WRA, it’s the last writing assignment to complete, and Im looking forward to getting it done. So far I’ve got a page down need one more, I’m really happy this class doesnt have a final, gives me some extra time to focus on my economy class, I am terrible at econ so I will need that extra studying for the final!</p>
			Blog Entry #11	</p> <p>It’s the last week of classes and things are shaping up to be a difficult ending, I have two finals on Monday and all my WRA homework due midnight Monday. So it’s time for me to buckle in and get ready for some studying! </p>
			Blog Entry #12 </p> <p> MSU made it to the Rose Bowl with a big victory over Ohio State, It was a great game to watch especially because it came on finals weekend. It was a great boost and gave me some extra strength going into finals week. </p>
			Blog Entry #13 </p> <p>Im not sure how many blog entries we need to have completed, so Im going to enter in my last blog entry, I really enjoyed this class and will miss it the flexibility it gives me and the long deadlines gives me a lot of time to put some thought into my papers. I hope to continue to improve my html coding skills and maybe even put up a website! We will know with time, but none the less I had wonderful time learning!</p>
