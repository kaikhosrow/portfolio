			<p> 9/15/2013 </p> Just wanted to write down some thoughts on the first week of classes, I am a transfer student to MSU and this happens to be my first semester of classes. I feel comftorable with all my classes but there is a new atmosphere and structure here at MSU, at my previous institution, Albion College, the classes where much smaller. This is because Albion was tiny compared to MSU. I am used to more communication during and after class. Here it seems as if there is no communication during class and once class is over people put on there headphones and walk out. I hope that in the weeks to come I can meet more people and go to study sessions. Overall i'm very happy with MSU and am excited for the years to come. </p>
			9/18/2013 </p> Today we watched an interesting video, it protrayed a personal story aout a man who was gay. He grew up under tradgic circumstances, at a young age his uncle who was also gay resorted to suicide to escape. He described his disgust with his uncles decision to end his life and explained that now his only example is his Uncle's suicide. The video was very emotional and told the entire story from beginning to end. Though informal it did a great job protraying the emotion and story in ways that I believe a formal story could not.			</p>
			9/25/2013 </P> Today I had a struggle with technology, it was HORRIFIC! I like to assume that I am very talented when it comes to things like computers, smart phones, email, and financial transactions which are heavily web based. Well this is a rant if you haven't already figured out. To start the list my computer at school is freezing up and very slow. I know I can not controll it but it still is very frustrating. Another thing I can not control is the internet going out. Which it did periodically during my class today. I hope this is not a school wide issue as I have my CSE class in a couple of hours and am already holding anger in. On to the next item on the list smart phones, my smart phone seems to be malfunctioning due to age and setting alarms on its own, great for a day full of class I love being stared at by 100's of my peers in a 650 person economy class at 10 in the morning when I am wide awake and ready to fix the problem, NOT. My email and paypal are one problem as well paypal says I do not have an email linked with the account when in fact I do I acutally have two of my emails linked with paypal. Technology is really giving it to me right now. </p>
			10/09/2013 </p> Watching the social network in class was fun the movie was very informative and taught me a lot about facebook from a buisness perspective. The effect of facebook on communication was drastic, communicating became much easier after the invention of facebook. Facebook was made based on technology and html code this technology gave birth to facebook which in turn gave birth to a new way of communication, linking all three together. Technology introduced a new way of writing, called html and coding, which introduced a new way of communicating through facebook.</p>
