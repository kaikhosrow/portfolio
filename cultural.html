Cultural Analysis Proposal Drafting Activity
1.	My purpose is to discuss the cultural artifact Family Guy and its relevance to the social issue of obesity
2.	Cultural Artifact: I will use the TV series Family Guy as my cultural artifact. I will focus on particular episodes within the series that deal directly with the social issue of obesity. 
3.	The social Issue as mentioned above will be obesity
4.	My personal position on the issue is that obesity is a freedom. It is up to the individual to make the healthy choice of not being obese. I believe that through informative action such as education at a young age of the health risks associated with obesity the individual will make an informed decision of not being obese.
5.	I believe that the education at a young age will teach kids that being obese is unhealthy and in turn reduce the obesity rate in the long run. As for those already obese and out of school I believe that government paid commercials aimed at informing the masses will make a positive impact to help reduce the obesity rate. 
Executive Summary
The social issue I intend to use is the issue of obesity, I believe that the cultural artifact, Family Guy does a good job in specific episodes exposing the issue. I will analyze how Family Guy’s episodes have an impact on society and how it may alter the perception of its viewers. The purpose of my report will be to show how obesity is unhealthy, that it is a personal choice and a freedom, and how education will help lower the rate of obesity. My main argument will be that through education and informative action we can lower the obesity rate drastically. My position on this issue is that obesity is a personal freedom and though it may be unhealthy and potentially deadly it is the individuals’ freedom to be or not be obese. I do believe that obesity is a health epidemic that is affecting many people. My proposed solution to obesity will be to educate the youth and inform them of the possible health risks through classes in elementary through high schools, we can implement lessons in health classes. 
Detailed Outline
P1	 Introduce the social issue obesity including quotes on the current statistics of obesity. Then I will introduce the cultural artifact Family Guy by giving a brief description of the show, Peter an obese father and his daily life, I will describe the two and give a background to the reader of both, showcase how the two relate, primarily peter and obesity. With a focus on the social issue.
P2	Discuss in depth how Family Guy illustrates obesity, focusing on some handpicked episodes that illustrate obesity specifically. Off the top of my head I remember an episode where peter gets laid off from work and becomes a couch potato he becomes obese and literally lives on his couch for some time, this is unhealthy and cost peter life experiences. I will analyze peters life choice of becoming obese and how it is negatively affecting his life in terms of health and personality. Later in the episode Peter goes outside for a walk and realizes how much he is missing out on, he then becomes a fisherman and has a great time with the new experiences. I will showcase how a healthy lifestyle is more exciting and beneficial to ones’ self. 
P3	Analyze how my cultural artifact presents obesity to its viewers, and just how the viewers will be influenced by Family Guy’s illustration of obesity.
P4   I will provide my solution to obesity, “through educating the youth the obesity rate will fall” show statistics showing how education at a young age can influence the choices they make down the road. 
P5	 Conclude with a summarization of my proposal 
 

Now that I am attending Michigan State University I am very glad of the choice I have made, I am surrounded by great people and am studying something I am truly passionate about and enjoy. Accounting is a hard major to comprehend and I am up for the challenge, the lifelong training really helps but there is a long way to go before I can call myself a truly accomplished accountant. I am blessed to be in the position I am in and am forever grateful to all those that helped guide me to the position I am in today.</p>
