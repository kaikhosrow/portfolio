Health has become a major issue in today’s world, with a focus on how to prevent disease and early death. Obesity has become one of the largest growing health issues in America and leads to both preventable disease and early expiration. Based on data gathered by the CDC, The center for Disease Control and Prevention, “more than one third of U.S. adults are considered obese, at a whopping 35.7%.”(CDC, 1) Not to mention, “The estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the U.S. was $147 billion in 2008”(CDC, 1) Obesity related health conditions are countless, obesity can affect the heart, cause stroke, diabetes, and increase the likelihood of cancer. In a popular TV series, Family Guy the main character Peter is obese. The show is about his daily life and whacky experiences that Peter embarks on himself and with his family/friends. The TV show illustrates in many ways how obesity is dealt with by average Americans. The struggles and health costs associated with obesity are portrayed well in two particular episodes specifically aimed at the issue. </p>

In one episode of Family Guy, peter gets laid off from work and becomes a couch potato he comes to be obese and literally lives on the couch for some time. Throughout this time a lot of Peters Friends would invite him to social events and gatherings, but Peter kept declining these invitations. Peter’s life choice of becoming obese is negatively affecting his life in terms of health and personality. He starts to feel pains all over his body and is not the same Peter viewers are accustomed to in previous episodes. Later in the episode Peter goes outside for a walk and realizes how much he is missing out on life and vows to get more active and lose the weight he has gained. Peter’s new healthy lifestyle is more exciting and beneficial to not only himself but his family. The Griffins take part in many activities at the end of the episode which would not have happened had Peter remained Obese, such as a Picnic on the beach as well as fishing on a boat. The episode focused on the negativities of obesity.</p>

In another episode Peter visits his doctor for an annual checkup. The doctor tells peter that he is getting a little too overweight, to prevent health risks he urges peter to get his weight back down. Peter seemed astonished at first but soon takes pride in the fact that he is overweight, he establishes a group called NAAFP. The national association for the advancement of fat people is an organization for the overweight with a goal to improve the lives of its members. The slogan for the association is we are fat people with pride. The organization adopts an anthem which showcases the struggles and pride the people have. As the episode progresses we encounter many situations where the NAAFP members are made fun of, but through there brothers and sisters support they work to gain societies acceptance and eventually put an end to the discrimination they are faced. This episode represents how obese people are treated from time to time in society and how being prideful and resilient can put an end to discernment behavior.</p>

Both these episodes focus on the social issue of obesity, but there is a significant change in the position the writers take on the issue with each episode. In the first episode obesity is portrayed very negatively, almost comparable to a severe disease that devastates the individual. As peter becomes obese his activity in the community decreases just as it would when he catches a cold or illness. When Peter reestablishes a normal weight his activity picks back up. It is not true that obesity directly makes individuals lazy and lethargic; this influences viewers to believe this inaccuracy. This false representation quite possibly induces the viewers into believing obesity will make them inactive like being sick or ill. This portrayal is very extreme and most likely negatively impacted the Family Guy viewers in regards to obesity. This sort of representation of obesity happens to be found in many shows that are currently on the air. The position seems to change in the second episode that is aired by Family Guy. In this episode the writers focus on the struggles obese people face in society. Such as being made fun of and lacking a support group to communicate with. The episode focuses on how obesity is a real issue by having Peter establish the NAAFP, the group meets to help each other through the struggles of obesity as well as to present ideas to improve the current state of their lives. </p>

In conclusion both episodes involve Peter being obese. Though each episode had its own special story regarding obesity the summary is that obesity is bad. Being obese is exposed to the viewers as a negative health issue with negative side effects. By showing how lazy Peter gets when he is obese alarms viewers into thinking that this could potentially happen to them if they do not stay in shape. The viewers are influenced by Family Guy’s illustration of obesity in a very negative way, a way that could perhaps sway many to avoid obesity. Peter’s obesity causes him to have health issues and a dull lifeless personality. This affects the viewers by encouraging them to stay healthy and avoid Peter’s error of becoming obese.</p>

My position on the issue is that obesity is a personal freedom and though it may be unhealthy and potentially deadly, it is the individuals’ freedom to be or not be obese. Despite this, I do believe that obesity is a health epidemic that is affecting many people. My offered solution to reduce obesity rates will be to educate the youth and inform them of the conceivable health risks of obesity. Education conducted through classes in early elementary through high school levels can help prevent obesity. With implementation of lessons in health classes as well as science classes which illustrate the harm obesity has on the human body. As well as teaching students about healthy eating habits and influencing them in positive ways to establish routine exercise patterns. Obesity could very well become an epidemic of the past. I believe that through implementation of education directed at obesity we can reduce the obesity rate steadily with each and every passing year. </p>
