			<p>Accounting </p>

Depending on which discipline one chooses to study there will be a keen difference in the way writing, reading, and research are presented and operated. Communication and technology are also vital across all fields today. It is important to stay up to date on technology by communicating with other members of the field. The goal of the student is to become a participating member of their desired discipline by becoming involved in the disciplines unique forms of creating and communicating knowledge. Accounting is a distinctive discipline in regards to the way knowledge is created and shared. Many individuals associate accounting primarily with numbers and mathematics this is an incorrect assumption. </P>  </P>
The fact is there are many hundreds of thousands of professionally written documents pertaining to accounting. The discipline is based on mathematics and numbers but math and numbers cannot communicate knowledge without words. Writing is very essential within the discipline of accounting. When it comes to describing specific situations in the field and special occurrences, using words is the only way to do so. In order for the reader to truly grasp the situation there needs to be a written explanation. Numbers need to be accompanied by words in order for an accountant to reach the most utmost efficiency. Reading is how the foundation is built for accountants; all students will be reading a great deal when learning the basics. While studying to become an accountant students will have to read much more than words, accounting is made up of graphs, tables, and special mathematical equations. Accounting is one of the rare disciplines where reading is not isolated to only words. Understanding and extracting knowledge are the primary goals when reading graphs tables and other visually based publications. It is very important to be able to understand and quickly extract information while reading. Accounting is always evolving, as we adapt to an ever changing world accounting will continue to change as well. Research is required to understand more about certain areas of the field, as well as updated forms of accounting related programs and styles. Research helps keep all members of the discipline connected and up to date with current standards. Research is a form of communication within the field of accounting as there are many research trade publications and organizations devoted to the field. Writing, reading, and research define most forms of discipline, when it comes to accounting there are high expectations equally spread amongst the three; an efficient accountant is solid in all three categories.

When writing is referred to in accounting, it could mean a variety of things. A proficient writer in the field of accounting should be able to compose a variety of forms of writing. For instance computer applications such as excel are very relevant, and require the understanding of the formulas graphs and tables. Writing tables and graphs are not the only important ways of writing. In an article written for the Journal of Accounting Education for California State University author Eugene Corman makes a great point of how accounting courses give the student a well-rounded learning experience when it comes to writing. The focus in accounting courses is to teach the students the technical content of the course, with an equally large focus on the quality of the composition written by the student. The way the technical content is displayed, analyzed, and summarized is very vital to a successful paper. Corman has a strong valid point, if accounting students are not taught to display technical content in a well written format, the statistics and numbers are rendered useless. In fact the scholarly article depicts that the average accountant will spend nearly twenty five percent of their time writing formal reports or papers to either their clients or management. When nearly a quarter of one’s career is devoted to writing, the writing better be good. 

Accounting students and graduates must have a high level of technological literacy. When talking to Fran a local Accounts receivable payable and payroll accountant, technological literacy became an obvious issue. Fran has been working with a local firm for over twenty years, she expressed to me how she struggled through the technological changes that hit the industry nearly ten years ago and never stopped. Accountants who graduate twenty years ago or today are held to the same standards of technological literacy. As new software becomes available to accountants they must be implemented because they save time and effort. These new software require extra work on part of the accountant, research and reading must be done to completely comprehend the software and its uses. In essence an accountant will always be researching and learning of new ways to complete the job. In Fran’s specific case she was introduced to a new program by a friend, which ended up saving her a great deal of time when calculating payroll. Accounting goes hand in hand with technology; nearly all of an accountants work will at some point be entered into a computer or documented online. </p>
An accountant will always be reading, while in school the focus is on graphs tables and numbers but as education comes to a close and the fundamentals are fully understood reading research papers and formally written essays becomes more prevalent in an accountants life. Some forms of the tables are visually similar to the one presented in the visual provided above.   
In this particular table presented below there are several factors for sales, reading these statistics and gathering information from them is what is expected from the accountant when reading. The information gathered is then compiled into a short paragraph or paper presenting the key points and areas of emphasis. An accountant will have to read the accounting information and translate it into a written way that everyone can apprehend and appreciate. The meaning of the numbers in the accounting world needs to be translated for everyone else to understand. First the accountant must extract the information from graphs and tables and break them down into a professional written format presentable to either management or clientele. In figure 1.2 shown above we see reading in a whole new way. That is from a computer program. Accountants will use computers throughout their entire careers. It starts from the first day of class to the day of retirement. Computer programs can help by organizing numbers and keeping accounts separated. Using computers and computer programs was a revolutionary movement in the field over twenty years ago, and with the evolution of technology accounting is becoming much easier to manage from an organization and structural viewpoint. Reading the information from accounting programs on computers has become an important part of the discipline. It is very important that all members of the field are capable of running programs such as Excel and other accounting programs. 


Programs have a variety of ways to display information, in this table we see multiple tabs which will show us much more information. The programs often hide equations and do not provide detailed information about each transaction in order to simplify the reading experience. To gather more information about a specific transaction the accountant must be able to read the program efficiently and thoroughly. Reading for accountants is not as black and white as one would think there are a lot of different ways an accountant must train themselves to be a proficient reader. Many accountants believe figuring out how to read every form of accounting is the most difficult part of accounting.
Communication is vital between the clients or management and accountants. When working alongside other accountants to complete a job such as a school project or a professional audit, there is no room for confusion or errors. Communication and assigning of each member’s duties must be dealt with right from the start. During the process all major developments must be communicated thoroughly too each member in a timely manner in order to push the entire project in the right direction. It is important to keep in mind that in accounting the slightest changes can have large implications on the outcome. For instance a tax increase of just half a percent can be the difference between a profitable or bankrupting position. The ability for accountants to always be communicating with those around them to ensure that everyone is up to date and informed of the current status of all projects, is absolutely necessary. As technology becomes a superior part of the accounting world, new software and programs with improved ways of completing a table or graph must be shared throughout the accounting profession via communication. There are several ways accountants stay up to date on ground breaking advancements in the field. For instance every accounting graduate who receives there CPA is enrolled in a CPA only communication program which updates the graduated accountants of any new or interesting news in the accounting world. This sort of communication is exclusive to graduates and keeps everyone involved. This unique way of communication allows for ideas to be spread freely and for the best notions to thrive.</p>
Accounting research is the most important aspect of accounting, because people are making decisions based on accounting information every day, most of which have vast economic implications on our lives. The study of accounting information and asking questions is how research is done in the field. Accounting information is used by the market and is how investors value companies. Research within accounting can range over a broad list of topics from insider trading, to short selling, to economic impacts of accounting, to auditing. The broad range of topics keeps research lively and very question answer based. Accounting research is all about stretching the boundaries of accounting to help answer a broad range of new questions. Accounting research has a great deal to do with the stock market; research is sought after by the capital markets in order to accurately value companies for trade and initial offerings. As a student the understanding of the capital markets is very important, accounting goes hand in hand with economics. Research can be confusing for accountants; as mentioned earlier there are three different formats for accountants and they are always being updated. The different formats require different ways of presenting numbers as well as different equations. It is important to keep the three formats disjointed from one another while researching. In an article presented by The American Institute of CPA’s the available online library was discussed in detail. There are a great deal of guides, disclosures, checklists, and manuals available for every format in the accounting profession. As an up and coming accountant the understanding of these three formats can only be obtained through research. The online library is vast and up to date. Research is tremendously important, it is up to the student to completely understand the formats and how to use them. Upon graduation and a career, the accountant must frequently use their research ability to get up to date knowledge on the formats as well as any new technologies or programs available that may make themselves more efficient. There are many careers available in accounting research due to the demand from shareholders in order to make smart financial decisions in the stock market. The same sort of financial accounting research is done by analysts to make earnings forecasts. Financial accounting research can investigate standards that companies need to adhere to and analyze these standards. In order for firms and companies to follow through with new standards research is necessary. 

Research can also reveal ways for companies to be more efficient, there are many careers devoted to the research of business’s income and balance sheets to find was to improve efficiency and in turn make the company more profitable. By looking into other rival companies accounting work researchers can learn their means of profitability and build their own companies based on these successful policies. Much if not all of accounting research is done with the use of technology. Most financial information can be found online especially if the financial information is of a company that is publically traded. This allows for information to be widely available and open giving the field a lot of research capability. On average a CPA will spend nearly thirty five percent of their entire career researching and analyzing in the field of accounting. 

Writing, reading, and research are extremely valuable components in the field of accounting. All three are vital to one’s success in the field, and without communication and technology the discipline would not be what it is today. Computer programs are also very relevant as well as communication via the internet. Reading and writing are both very unique in this field, one has to learn how to be able to read and write graphs and tables on paper as well as on computers. Accountants must be able to run accounting programs. Research is always evolving in this field, mainly because of new standards and an ever evolving economy. There is a great deal of career paths in accounting finding the one that matches the individual’s strengths is key. Research, writing, and reading are equally important to this discipline, to be a great accountant you have to have a great foundation in all three.
