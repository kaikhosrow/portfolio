			<p>Accounting </p>

Depending on which discipline one chooses to study there will be a keen difference in the way writing, reading, and research are presented and operated. Communication and technology are also vital across all fields today. It is important to stay up to date on technology by communicating with other members of the field. The goal of the student is to become a participating member of their desired discipline by becoming involved in the disciplines unique forms of creating and communicating knowledge. Accounting is a distinctive discipline in regards to the way knowledge is created and shared. Many individuals associate accounting primarily with numbers and mathematics this is an incorrect assumption. </P> As the year goes on more will be added, Stay Tuned KC Soroushian </P>
The fact is there are many hundreds of thousands of professionally written documents pertaining to accounting. The discipline is based on mathematics and numbers but math and numbers cannot communicate knowledge without words. Writing is very essential within the discipline of accounting. When it comes to describing specific situations in the field and special occurrences, using words is the only way to do so. In order for the reader to truly grasp the situation there needs to be a written explanation. Numbers need to be accompanied by words in order for an accountant to reach the most utmost efficiency. Reading is how the foundation is built for accountants; all students will be reading a great deal when learning the basics. While studying to become an accountant students will have to read much more than words, accounting is made up of graphs, tables, and special mathematical equations. Accounting is one of the rare disciplines where reading is not isolated to only words. Understanding and extracting knowledge are the primary goals when reading graphs tables and other visually based publications. It is very important to be able to understand and quickly extract information while reading. Accounting is always evolving, as we adapt to an ever changing world accounting will continue to change as well. Research is required to understand more about certain areas of the field, as well as updated forms of accounting related programs and styles. Research helps keep all members of the discipline connected and up to date with current standards. Research is a form of communication within the field of accounting as there are many research trade publications and organizations devoted to the field. Writing, reading, and research define most forms of discipline, when it comes to accounting there are high expectations equally spread amongst the three; an efficient accountant is solid in all three categories.

When writing is referred to in accounting, it could mean a variety of things. A proficient writer in the field of accounting should be able to compose a variety of forms of writing. For instance computer applications such as excel are very relevant, and require the understanding of the formulas graphs and tables. Writing tables and graphs are not the only important ways of writing. In an article written for the Journal of Accounting Education for California State University author Eugene Corman makes a great point of how accounting courses give the student a well-rounded learning experience when it comes to writing. The focus in accounting courses is to teach the students the technical content of the course, with an equally large focus on the quality of the composition written by the student. The way the technical content is displayed, analyzed, and summarized is very vital to a successful paper. Corman has a strong valid point, if accounting students are not taught to display technical content in a well written format, the statistics and numbers are rendered useless. In fact the scholarly article depicts that the average accountant will spend nearly twenty five percent of their time writing formal reports or papers to either their clients or management. When nearly a quarter of one’s career is devoted to writing, the writing better be good. 

Accounting students and graduates must have a high level of technological literacy. When talking to Fran a local Accounts receivable payable and payroll accountant, technological literacy became an obvious issue. Fran has been working with a local firm for over twenty years, she expressed to me how she struggled through the technological changes that hit the industry nearly ten years ago and never stopped. Accountants who graduate twenty years ago or today are held to the same standards of technological literacy. As new software becomes available to accountants they must be implemented because they save time and effort. These new software require extra work on part of the accountant, research and reading must be done to completely comprehend the software and its uses. In essence an accountant will always be researching and learning of new ways to complete the job. In Fran’s specific case she was introduced to a new program by a friend, which ended up saving her a great deal of time when calculating payroll. Accounting goes hand in hand with technology; nearly all of an accountants work will at some point be entered into a computer or documented online. </p>
