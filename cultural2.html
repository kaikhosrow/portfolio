		<h1>Cultural Analysis</h1>
							<p>						 </p>
I am a firm believer that the public will make positive choices when informed and educated. If we can teach the youth about all the risks associated with obesity such as these the choice becomes very obvious. “Research has shown that as weight increases to reach the levels referred to as "overweight" and "obesity," the risks for the following conditions also increases coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer, hypertension, stroke, liver disease, respiratory problems…” (CDC 2) If we can educate the future generation about the harm and potential deadliness of obesity I believe they will make a positive choice in staying healthy. Shows like Family Guy play a big part in helping to reduce obesity. Though family guy doesn’t educate viewers on the statistics and real risks of obesity it does present the negative social aspects of the issue, such as indirect laziness and change in lifestyle. Family Guy did a good job presenting a whole other issue in its self, and that is how the public reacts to obese people. After watching Family Guy I recalled certain instances where obese people where made fun of and mocked. This behavior is unacceptable and hurtful to those who are obese. Though this a separate issue, it directly affects the lives of those who are obese in a negative way. This presentation in Family Guy was eye opening to the viewers and hopefully impacted them to stop these hurtful actions. Obesity is an epidemic that can and will be solved.</p>

Obesity is unfortunately a big problem in the world today. It is surprisingly common amongst Americans; unfortunately the liabilities are extremely severe. It is dreadful to think that these Americans are willing to take these health risks instead of making a positive life prolonging choice of becoming healthy. The only way to change the future is to invest in education for those who will live on. Our future generations deserve a healthy long lived life, and by carrying out obesity education in schools we can ensure this goal. I close with an earlier statement, I am a firm believer that the public will make positive choices when informed and educated.</p>
