			<h1>Course Retrospective project </h1>
			<p>Final Project </p>

When I enrolled myself in this course, writing with a focus on science and technology I was not sure what sort of assignments and key concepts I would learn over the course of the semester. Well with one week to go I am very glad with the choice I made. The papers I have had the privilege to write over the past few weeks have helped me not only improve my overall writing skills but also learn more about myself. The course had four major writing assignments I had to fulfill over the course of this semester. Each assignment required me to use different types of writing and focus on different subjects. Asides from writing we had graded assignments for making, and keeping up to date, our very own online blog. We also focused on using html code to produce online versions of our essays. This course is different than other writing courses in a good way; this is because there are so many learning outcomes from this course that would never be discussed in other writing courses. I truly enjoyed how science and technology was incorporated into the course.</p>
The first assignment, The Lived Experience project gave me an opportunity to write about something I was passionate about. In a narrative style of writing, the purpose of the assignment was to define the experiences we had throughout our lives that led us to choose our major. I focused on the personal experiences I had throughout my childhood that enlightened me to take the path that I am currently on. I went into detail on specific moments in my life where I had deep conversations with people that really paved the way for me to choose an accounting degree. The assignment was very fun to work on because of the writing style. Informal narrative gives the author a lot of room to be animated and open about their lived experiences. This paper is a great opportunity to be creative and to take a stroll down memory road. It is important to remember how you got to where you are and why you are here, and this assignment made me stand back and take a look at my life in retrospect. This was definitely my favorite paper and a great way to start off the semester. </p>
The second paper was more or less a project, and it took a span of three weeks to accomplish. It was a paper unlike any other I have written before. The requirements for the Cultural Analysis project are to analyze a piece of pop culture and present the positive or negative effects it has on society. This assignment allows the student to still pick a subject they are interested in and analyze it from different points of views than they would normally. The goal of the paper is to broaden the horizons and present an interesting analysis of a social issue. There is a lot of freedom in this paper; because the list of potential topics is endless. Social issues are always around you and can be easily analyzed. If you have a tough time writing papers then you will definitely find it easier to get this one done and done well, you can pick any topic so pick a topic that has a lot of importance to you. My cultural artifact was the show Family Guy which I really enjoy; it allowed me to easily get some ideas on paper and start a rough draft. I find that writing a paper on something I enjoy is ten times easier than on something not so fun. This was definitely a fun project with a great purpose. </p>
The third project was the formal research project; this is where we had to get serious. This sort of serious research based paper is what I am used to. Not as much fun, but still the type of paper we will be required to write more frequently once in the workforce. The project is a collaboration of all the assignments we have done to date, the goal is to showcase the skills we have built as well as writing structure we have picked up from the previous papers to create a great research paper. The goal of the paper is to reveal to the audience, your peers, the major which you are committed to and the background of the said major. The focal points of the paper are to showcase how technology, science, and research are used within the major. The important twist to the paper was that we had to analyze the major from the eyes of a student in college as well as someone in the work force. The research took a lot of time and hard work but I learned quite a bit about my major and with requirements like an interview it stretched the course even further from just a pen to a paper writing course.</p>
This course has so much more significance than just a writing course. There were a lot of unique course objectives that stand out such as the blog, html coding, and remix project to name a few. This made the course a lot more enjoyable than the traditional writing course which most of us have come accustomed to. Along the way I learned a lot about writing styles and how the writing style used can significantly change the vibe of the writing. All the projects did well to tie themselves together; this was the best part of the course, as we could see our hard work piece together to become a full sized master piece.</p>
The best advice I could give students who will be taking this course is to keep your head on a swivel, that is to make sure you are aware of all the due dates and keep up to date on the long term assignments such as the blog and html code academy. The course demands your attentions for spurts at a time so be prepared to work long hours in particular weeks and have a week off here and there. Looking back on the course now I would have greatly benefited from working ahead in this course. I would encourage students to give this course there best effort because you can really learn a lot about yourself and your major. </p>
