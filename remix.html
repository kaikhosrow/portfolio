MEMO</p>
To: Dr. Daniels</p>
From: Kaikhosrow Soroushian</p>
Subject: Remix Project Assessment</p>
Composing in Context</p>
We chose gun control as our issue we were faced with a problem right from the start, we were down a group member and since we needed someone to hold the camera at all times, it really limited what we could do in terms of cinematography. 
Process</p>
We came together as a 2 member group and discussed the topics we wrote about and concluded that gun control fit the agenda well. The most challenging part of this entire project for me was leading the group, like I mentioned earlier we never heard from one member and the other member was not involved until the video. A challenging part was piecing together the video, as well as making the script. </p>
Research</p>
I was not involved much with research we got a few important statistics in our video, the statistics are eye opening and should have an impact on the audience</p>
Collaboration</p>
There was very limited interaction with my group. One member stepped up to the plate and gave a notable effort and that was Wang, he showed up to the meeting on time and did a fair share of the work. That being said the other two members did not help what so ever with the written portion. A third member was involved in the video. It was really challenging to put together a project that was meant for four people with the limited help. If I could do this again I would have really liked to have known about this assignment earlier so that I could find team members that would give as strong an effort as I did. </p>
Project Management </p>
We had a plan from the start we set meeting dates and I was excited to work on this, the problem was when half the group fails to show up it is tough to overcome. 
The biggest problem with our project is the sound volume; we were not speaking loud enough so it is really hard to hear.  </p>
Documentary Design</p>
Again we were limited to what we could do with a camera holder and two actors, we could only do basic back and forth communication and interviews.</p>
