		<h1>My life experiences and major choice</h1>
		<p>Throughout my life my grandma has played an important role. She lived in the same neighborhood as me while I was growing up and acted as a second mother to both my brother and I. My grandma always encouraged me to study and took to great lengths to improve my mathematical skills. In elementary school my grandma would improve my math skills by quizzing my basic multiplication and division questions in the car in route to our destination. The quiz was like a game show, for every right answer I was given a piece of candy or a sip of soda. The constant practice and positive reinforcement helped to improve my math skills substantially and by the time I reached high school I was taking advanced math courses. I owed all my current success to my grandma, who encouraged me right from the beginning. </p>
I was no longer doing basic multiplication or division problems in high school, instead much more complex problems requiring the use of calculators and a few pieces of paper. To be honest I did not enjoy these complex problems as much as the simpler problems I had faced in elementary and middle school. I questioned my grandma one day, when will I use these complicated equations outside of school? She replied if you don’t like those complicated problems then you should be an accountant they do a great deal of basic math problems but cannot make a single mistake. My mind lit up with fascination, wondering what exactly an accountant’s job entailed, and why it is they cannot make a mistake. From this point on I had a fascination with accounting and wondered what sort of education is needed to become an accountant. </p>
By the time my junior and senior year of high school came about there was a great deal of emphasis placed on educating the students of possible career paths. The school invited many people of different professions to the school to talk about their career and what a typical day is like. Amongst the many that came to speak was an accountant who focused on the use of computers and new technology to assist in the creation of reports and keeping track of statistics. The speaker noted that an accountant uses a computer on a daily basis and is considered the number one tool of an accountant. I enjoy using computers and was very pleased to hear this, after all throughout my entire life I had been exceptional at using computers. Besides the speaker that came to the school there were other opportunities to learn about career paths in school using web programs and applications on school computers. I found the answers to the many questions I had about an accounting major and what the job was really like in these last two years of high school. </p>
My passion for accounting truly began to blossom when I met one of my mother’s friend who was an accountant for a local business. She was in charge of accounts receivables and payables and told me about the everyday responsibilities she had as an accountant. The stories she told where exciting, some about how she would sometimes have to accomplish last minute tasks under pressure to pass an audit, and also some less tense stories about the vacation time she received and the facilities available to her at work such as a gym and Laundromat. I was amazed to hear this! I learned that an accountants job can vary based on their focus in college. The most important thing I learned from her is that most accountants use computers to help with the job. Programs such as excel speed the job up by doing most of the math automatically. I have always been good at using computers but up to this point never knew much about excel. I decided that I would want to learn more about excel and the other applications I did not use to see what it would be like. In my senior year I took a computer class which taught me the basics about these applications, it turns out there is nothing exciting about excel or these other applications, but it was great to learn the basic fundamentals which I had no problem understanding. </p>
When I received my admission to MSU I was ready to commit to accounting as my major. All the people that reached out to me throughout high school helped me find the career path that was right for me I will be forever great full to these people. I owe the most thanks to my grandma, it all started with her little quizzes in the car that helped me develop my math skills quicker than those in my class and in turn allow me to take advance math classes in high school. I was focused not only in my math class but others as well because of this passion inside of me to be great. This passion was lit by my grandma and to this day I work hard to not only make myself proud buy my family as well.  
Now that I am attending Michigan State University I am very glad of the choice I have made, I am surrounded by great people and am studying something I am truly passionate about and enjoy. Accounting is a very hard major to comprehend and I am up for the challenge, the lifelong training really helps but there is a long way to go before I can call myself a truly accomplished accountant. I am blessed to be in the position I am in and am forever grateful to all those that helped guide me to the position I am in today.
